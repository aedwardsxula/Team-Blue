2. Arrange: Create a tiny dataset of 4 records with the required numeric attributes age, bmi, children, charges
   Act: Call your function that calculates count, mean, std, min, 25th, 50th, 75th, max for each attribute (age, bmi, children, charges.)
   Verify the outputs exactly as numbers rounded here to 4 decimals. If every asserted value matches (within tolerance), the test passes.

Problem 1 Test:
//Arrange

var sex = ''
var direction = ''
var poilicy_holder = ''
int age = 0
int premuim_cost =  0
int bmi = 0 

//Act 

System.out.println(direction)

//Assert

if (direction == True) {
    System.out.println("Test was successful")
}

Problem 3 Test: horizontal text-based histogram of the age 
Arrange: The ages for this code should be variables inputted by
the user or coder and taken from the csv. A dictionary should be 
used to count how many customers are a certain age. The range inputs for
the histogram intervals, and the first interval number should be inputted (no magic numbers). 
Act: Generate histogram string.
The range segments should be
Assert: The output for the data of this csv, if 15 (starting number), and 5
(interval length) are inputted

15 - 20: **
20 - 25:
25 - 30: *
30 - 35: **
35 - 40: 
40 - 45:
45 - 50: *

Problem 5 Test: Total number of records for each number of children
Test 1: If number of children is zero
Arrange: Identify the ages of the clients in the data set. Have the 
cut off age for a child be input as a variable. Have a sum/total variable 
to record number of records of clients that fit the criteria.
Act: Generate the total number of records for each children 
Assert: The output should be: 
The total number of records for children is: 0 

Test 2: If a client's age is 0
Arrange: Identify the ages of the clients in the data set. Have the 
cut off age for a child be input as a variable. Have a sum/total variable. Do
not a client who is aged 0 in the total 
Act: Generate the total number of records for each child
Assert: The output should be (with the client input of 15, and the client ages
in the interval are 0, 12, 13):
The total number of records for children is: 2

Problem 7 Test: Fairness of data 
Test1: If data differs at more than 5%
Arrange: Identify the different regions, and create a variable for the sum of each
region's total amount of records. Ensure when subtracting these record amounts to find
the difference that the absolute value is used. 
Act: 
Assert:
