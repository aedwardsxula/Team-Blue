//Test for 3
// Arrange: Ages = [18, 18, 40, 44], Start=15, Interval=5
// Act: Run horizontal age histogram
// Assert: Output should show
// 15-20: ** (2)
// 20-25:  (0)
// 25-30:  (0)
// 30-35:  (0)
// 35-40:  (0)
// 40-45: ** (2)
// 45-50:  (0)

//Test for #15
// Arrange: Create dataset with 4 regions (north, south, east, west) 
// and different average charges per region.
// Act: Calculate average charge per region and sort them in descending order.
// Assert: Verify that regions are sorted from highest to lowest average charges.

//Test for #16
// Arrange: Create dataset with smoker ages [19, 22, 25] and non-smoker ages [40, 45, 60].
// Act: Calculate average age for smokers and non-smokers.
// Assert: Verify smoker average age < non-smoker average age.

//Test for #18
// Arrange: Create dataset where Southern BMI values average around 32 
// and Northern BMI values average around 26.
// Act: Calculate average BMI for each region.
// Assert: Verify South avg BMI > North avg BMI and report the average BMI of Southerners.

//Test for #19
// Arrange: Create dataset where Southerners have more children (avg 3) 
// than Northerners (avg 1), with recorded ages for each group.
// Act: Calculate average number of children by region and find average age 
// of Southern clients where this holds true.
// Assert: Verify South avg children > North avg children, and output the average age of Southerners.

// Test for #20
// Arrange: BMI = [20,25,30,35,40], Charges = [2000,4000,6000,8000,10000].
// Act: Compute regression (charges vs BMI) and Pearson r; predict 11 new BMI values.
// Assert: r > 0.9 and predicted charges rise with increasing BMI.
