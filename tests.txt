2. Arrange: Create a tiny dataset of 4 records with the required numeric attributes age, bmi, children, charges
   Act: Call your function that calculates count, mean, std, min, 25th, 50th, 75th, max for each attribute (age, bmi, children, charges.)
   Verify the outputs exactly as numbers rounded here to 4 decimals. If every asserted value matches (within tolerance), the test passes.

4. Arrange: Prepare a small set of BMI values to test. BMIs = [18.5, 22.0, 27.3, 31.0]
   Act: Run the function that generates the vertical histogram of the BMI values. Capture the output (either as a String or directly from the console).
   Assert: Compare the actual histogram output to the expected histogram and verify if each BMI value is counted in the correct bin, the histogram is vertical, the right number of symbols, and the labels at the bottom of the histogram match the bins.

6. Arrange: Create a small dataset of records with a smoker field (values "yes" or "no").
   Act: Run the function that generates the vertical histogram of smokers vs. non-smokers. Capture the output string
   Assert: Verify that the “Smokers” column has exactly 2 markers,verify that the “Non-Smokers” column has exactly 2 markers,verify that the histogram is vertical, and verify that the labels "Smokers" and "Non-Smokers" appear under their respective columns.

8. Arrange: Prepare a small sample dataset of records. Each record should include age and charges
   Act: Make sure the code Separates people into two groups, Calculates the average, Checks whether the older group’s average is at least twice the younger group’s average.
   Assert: Verify that The averages were computed correctly, The comparison logic, The function returns the expected boolean value

10. Arrange: Create a small test dataset with each person’s number of children and their total insurance charges.
    Act: Run the code that Groups records by the number of children, Calculates the average charge per child for each group, Checks if the average charge per child decreases as the number of children increases (True or False)
    Assert: The per-child charge values were calculated correctly,The relationship between number of children and per-child charge is correctly analyzed,The function returns the expected result (true for this dataset)

12 Arrange: Prepare a small dataset of smokers only, each with region and charges.
   Acts: Make sure the function Filters to smokers, Splits them into South, Computes the average, and Checks whether.
   Assert: Verify the computed averages match the manual values (within a small tolerance), Verify the comparison logic is correct, and Verify the final boolean result is TRUE for this dataset. 

14 Arrange: Prepare a small dataset of people, each record containing at least age and smoker.
   Act: Make sure the code Filters the dataset to include only smokers, Groups the remaining records by age range, Counts how many smokers fall into each age bin, and Produces a text-based histogram (horizontal or vertical)
   Assert: Verify that Only smokers were counted, Each age range correctly reflects the number of smokers, The histogram text (using # or *) matches the expected bin counts

16. Arrange: Create a small dataset with each person’s age and smoker status.
    Act: Make sure the code Separates smokers and non-smokers into two groups, Computes the average age for each group, Compares the two averages to determine whether smokers are generally younger, Returns the average smoker age and a boolean (true if smokers are younger)
    Asseert: Verify that The average age of smokers is correctly calculated, The average age of non-smokers is correctly calculated, The function correctly determines that smokers are, on average, younger, and The reported “average age where this is true” equals approximately 24.7 years for this dataset.
    
18. Arrange: Prepare a dataset that includes region and BMI for each person and Define the regions.
    Act: Make sure the code Divides records into “southern” and “northern” groups based on region, Calculates the average BMI for each group, Compares the averages to check whether Southerners have a higher average BMI, and Returns both averages and whether the hypothesis is true
