2. Arrange: Create a tiny dataset of 4 records with the required numeric attributes age, bmi, children, charges
   Act: Call your function that calculates count, mean, std, min, 25th, 50th, 75th, max for each attribute (age, bmi, children, charges.)
   Verify the outputs exactly as numbers rounded here to 4 decimals. If every asserted value matches (within tolerance), the test passes.

4. Arrange: Prepare a small set of BMI values to test. BMIs = [18.5, 22.0, 27.3, 31.0]
   Act: Run the function that generates the vertical histogram of the BMI values. Capture the output (either as a String or directly from the console).
   Assert: Compare the actual histogram output to the expected histogram and verify if each BMI value is counted in the correct bin, the histogram is vertical, the right number of symbols, and the labels at the bottom of the histogram match the bins.

6. Arrange: Create a small dataset of records with a smoker field (values "yes" or "no").
   Act: Run the function that generates the vertical histogram of smokers vs. non-smokers. Capture the output string
   Assert: Verify that the “Smokers” column has exactly 2 markers,verify that the “Non-Smokers” column has exactly 2 markers,verify that the histogram is vertical, and verify that the labels "Smokers" and "Non-Smokers" appear under their respective columns.

8. Arrange: Prepare a small sample dataset of records. Each record should include age and charges
   Act: Make sure the code Separates people into two groups, Calculates the average, Checks whether the older group’s average is at least twice the younger group’s average.
   Assert: Verify that The averages were computed correctly, The comparison logic, The function returns the expected boolean value
